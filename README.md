# Early Detection of Cervical Cancer Using Machine Learning

![Cervical Cancer](cervical_cancer_image.jpg)

Welcome to the **Early Detection of Cervical Cancer using Machine Learning** project repository. Our goal is to explore advanced machine-learning techniques for the early detection of cervical cancer. This repository contains a baseline predictive model and preprocessing code.

## Project Overview

Cervical cancer is a major health concern, but early detection can save lives. In this project, we harness the power of machine learning to predict and classify cervical cancer risks at an early stage.

## Key Features

- ðŸ¤– Baseline Model: Check out our initial machine-learning model for risk prediction.
- ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing: Dive into the data preprocessing code used to clean and prepare the dataset.
- ðŸ“Š Evaluation: Explore the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.
